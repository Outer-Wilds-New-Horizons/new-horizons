# Contributing

Thank you for choosing to contribute to New Horizons!

## Getting Started

To get started, [fork this repository](https://github.com/xen-42/outer-wilds-new-horizons/fork).  
Once you have a fork created, create a new branch off of `dev` where you will make your changes.  
Then, clone your fork and checkout your new branch.

## Building

To build a development release of New Horizons, use the `Debug` build target.  
This will automatically build to your mods directory in OWML (so long as it's in `%APPDATA%/OuterWildsModManager/OWML`).

### Getting Line Numbers

To save yourself the pain of decoding where in a function an error occured, you can [download this dll file](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/929787137895854100/936860223983976448/mono-2.0-bdwgc.dll) and place it in `MonoBleedingEdge/EmbedRuntime` of the game's folder.  
Then (so long as you build targeting `Debug`), line numbers will be shown in any error that comes from New Horizons

## Provide examples

When adding a new feature, include a complete set of planet config files that will sufficiently demonstrate the functionality of the feature/bug fix/improvement. This way reviewers can just copy paste these files into the New Horizons planets folder.

## Updating The Schema

When you add fields to config classes, please document them using XML documentation so that our action can generate a proper schema.

```cs
/// <summary>
/// This is my new field!
/// </summary>
public string myField;
```

You can also use `Range` (from `System.ComponentModel.DataAnnotations` NOT Unity), and `DefaultValue`:

```cs
/// <summary>
/// This is my new field!
/// </summary>
[Range(0, 100)]
[DefaultValue(50)]
public int myField;
```

### Enums

You can also setup enums in the config classes:

```cs
[JsonConverter(typeof(StringEnumConverter))]
public enum MyCoolEnum {
    [EnumMember(Value = @"value1")]
    Value1 = 0,
    [EnumMember(Value = @"value2")]
    Value2 = 1,
}

/// <summary>
/// My enum field
/// </summary>
public MyCoolEnum enumField;
```

These will automatically be converted from strings to the proper enum type.
