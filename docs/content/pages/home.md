# Outer Wilds New Horizons
        
This is the official documentation for [New Horizons](https://github.com/xen-42/outer-wilds-new-horizons), a framework for creating custom planets in the game [Outer Wilds](https://www.mobiusdigitalgames.com/outer-wilds.html) by Mobius Digital. Planets are created using simple JSON and XML files and are loaded at runtime. An [API]({{ "API"|route }}) is also provided for more advanced use-cases.

## Getting Started

For a guide on getting started an getting familiar with New Horizons, go to the [Getting Started]({{ "Getting Started"|route }}) page.

## Helpful Resources

The texturemap/heightmap feature was inspired by the Kerbal Space Program mod Kopernicus. A lot of the same techniques that apply to
planet creation there apply to New Horizons. If you need help with planetary texturing, check out [The KSP texturing guide](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/topic/165285-planetary-texturing-guide-repository/){ target="_blank" }.

[Photopea](https://www.photopea.com/){ target="_blank" } is a free browser-based photo editor which has useful features like
rectangular-to-polar coordinate transformation, useful for fixing abnormalities at the poles of your planets.
