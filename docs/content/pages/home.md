# Welcome!
        
This is the official documentation for [New Horizons](https://github.com/xen-42/outer-wilds-new-horizons)
        
## Getting Started

There is a template [here](https://github.com/xen-42/ow-new-horizons-config-template){ target="_blank" } if you want to release your own planet mod using configs. You can learn how the configs work by picking apart the [Real Solar System](https://github.com/xen-42/outer-wilds-real-solar-system){ target="_blank" } mod or the [New Horizons Examples](https://github.com/xen-42/ow-new-horizons-examples){ target="_blank" } mod.

Planets are created using a JSON file format structure, and placed in a folder called planets (or in any subdirectory of it) in the location where New Horizons is installed (by default this folder doesn't exist, you have to create it within the xen.NewHorizons directory).

To locate this directory, click the "â‹®" symbol next to "New Horizons" in the Outer Wilds Mod Manager and then click "show in explorer" in the pop-up.
