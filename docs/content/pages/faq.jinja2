	{{

			"is-easy",
			"How easy is it to make a planet mod?", 
			"Easy, you don't even need to know how to code! Just start off slowly and make a single planet with a few surface details. Don't try to make a full DLC-scale story mod on your first try."
		) 
	}}
	{{ 
		faq(
			"model-whole-planet",
			"Can I model my entire planet in Blender and put it into the game?", 
			"Yes! Follow the instructions on the Detailing page. All you have to do is add that model as a single detail prop at the center of the planet."
		) 
	}}
	{{ 
		faq(
			"why-no-planet",
			"Why doesn't my planet show up in game?", 
			"Have you checked the logs for errors? Are you using a program like [VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/){ target='_blank' } to write your configs that validates them against our schema to catch your errors? Do you incrementally test each new planet that you add, or did you write 10 json files and then try them all at once? If you're still not sure, come by our [Discord channel](https://discord.gg/wusTQYbYTc){ target='_blank' } (`#nh-addon-discussion`) and we'll try to help out!"

		faq(
			"rails",
			"Will you ditch the physics simulation and instead track planet positions on their orbits as a function of time, effectively putting the planets on rails and thereby making the game more efficient and accurate at the expense of the game's original vision as being an actual simulation of orbital mechanics?",
